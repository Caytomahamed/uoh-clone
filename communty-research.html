            ABOUT UNIVERSITY OF HARGEISA RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraphy">
            The University which is currently the biggest and leading national
            institution of higher learning in Somaliland, has the mandate
            bestowed upon it by the law to conduct research, disseminate and
            publish research outputs and innovations, and provide community
            services. Since its inception, the university has been active in the
            teaching-learning process, however, the university was not strongly
            engaged in research and knowledge transfer. To this effect the
            contribution of the university in national development was minimal.
            In 2016 the University has established a directorate for research
            and community service in order to fill this gap. To feel the gap,
            the office of research and community service has taken the
            initiative to both improve the research culture and output as well
            as serve the local community.

          of themes is also needed that could help in prioritizing funding,
          research project evaluation and approval. Funding is strictly based on
          thematic and priority areas for research. The following guiding
          principles are used in priority setting of research:

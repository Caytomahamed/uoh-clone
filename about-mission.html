            Beginning in the classroom with exposure to new ideas, new ways of
            understanding, and new ways of knowing, students embark on a journey
            of intellectual transformation. Through a diverse living
            environment, where students live with people who are studying
            different topics, who come from different walks of life and have
            evolving identities, intellectual transformation is deepened and
            conditions for social transformation are created. From this we hope
            that students will begin to fashion their lives by gaining a sense
            of what they want to do with their gifts and talents, assessing
            their values and interests, and learning how they can best serve the
            world.

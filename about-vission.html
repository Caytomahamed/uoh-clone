              Beginning in the classroom with exposure to new ideas, new ways of
              understanding, and new ways of knowing, students embark on a
              journey of intellectual transformation. Through a diverse living
              environment, where students live with people who are studying
              different topics, who come from different walks of life and have
              evolving identities, intellectual transformation is deepened and
              conditions for social transformation are created. From this we
              hope that students will begin to fashion their lives by gaining a
              sense of what they want to do with their gifts and talents,
              assessing their values and interests, and learning how they can
              best serve the world.
